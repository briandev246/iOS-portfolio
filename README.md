* I used UIKit APIs new to iOS13 (compositional layout and diffable datasource) to enable user to browse featured movies in a Netflix-style UI.

* Featured movies are displayed in a UICollectionView where each section (now playing, upcoming, trending, top-rated) is a row that itself is scrollable left-to-right.

* When a user taps on a movie, the detail page for that movie is displayed and the user is able to add that movie to their personal watchlist.

* User can also add any other movie to their watchlist by searching the full dataset of movies using UISearchController.
